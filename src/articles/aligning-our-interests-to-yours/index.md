Insurance executives are hearing everyday from analysts and management
consultancies about the catalytic impact of InsureTech on their operating
models, and imploring them to invest in potentially disruptive business models.
Having seen this first hand, we decided to develop a set of solutions to affect
this change with our clients.

The last several years have seen the continued prevalence of artificial
intelligence in our lives: e-mail spam filters, tailored recommendations for
purchases on Amazon, movie recommendations on Netflix, and iTunes music
recommendations are examples of a few. But where are the applications of this
proven technology in the Insurance space? Big firms with AI platforms are more
interested in selling large AI licenses for sandboxes, and leaving the true
innovation to the carriers themselves. This is a waste of time and capital for
insurance companies, as they often don’t need the computing power that comes
with such huge investments. They need practical solutions at reasonable levels
of investment.

So if the big technology players won’t bring AI to insurance, who will? Often
the investment profile and risk averse nature of business models of large
players, technology or otherwise, don’t allow for the type of greenfield
solutioning or compensation models the marketplace requires.

The leadership of Spraoi have brought together over four decades of insurance
industry experience together with Silicon Valley technologists from Apple to
develop practical AI applications for carriers. We have a business model that
aligns our clients outcomes with our compensation. We have defined the models
and are ready to work with you to implement solutions.

Now doesn’t that sound better than a simple recommendation or piece of advice?
