Simple, elegant solutions cannot be developed using complicated processes and
delivery methodologies. As an industry, insurance has looked to move from the
traditional waterfall development paradigm to agile delivery. However, the term
agile sends shivers down the spine of most executives today. As technology
solution companies, we are prone to think of delivery in the context of
technology delivery without always accounting for process implications and
disruption that comes with the introduction of a new technology. An elegant way
to deliver a solution that is adopted more readily across the organization is to
offer a delivery mechanism that teams can rally around and more importantly wrap
their heads around. So how should one solve for it?

I prefer to think of the next delivery wave to be one that uses agile principles
that are adapted to the needs of insurers. Further more, use an incremental
shift in the delivery methodology to have a more a pragmatic approach to
shifting the delivery discipline of an organization. Start with simple small
projects that can &quot;fit&quot; within the existing organizational model and
structures with minimal process interruption. Have a small set of
&quot;champions&quot; work in the context of this &quot;smaller&quot; engagement
to better understand the benefits and ROI of the new delivery discipline. The
champions can then serve as ambassadors and the successful engagement as a case
study for the roll out of the delivery discipline.

There is no &quot;silver bullet&quot; delivery methodology that can be used out
of the box for every business problem. The focus needs to be on being
&quot;Agile&quot; in adapting the delivery framework to each unique client
problem.
