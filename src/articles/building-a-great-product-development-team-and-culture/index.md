  Impact of right organizational culture cannot be overstated. An engineering
  mindset and culture are critical to quality product development and to
  marketplace success.

To be successful, any product development company needs a great engineering team
and culture. At Spraoi, we realized this from the beginning and have endeavored
to create a global product-focused engineering team, spread across US and India,
and an engineering culture that operates on the pillars of sincerity, openness
and teamwork while keeping the customer at the center.

We focused on a three-point action plan toward accomplishing this objective:

- Build the right team and enable an environment for high individual impact.
- Tap into the global talent pool, especially in India, and leverage its
  benefits for our customers.
- Create a single integrated unit that collaborates towards achieving our shared
  goals.

Here we share some of the insights and learning from our experiences.

## Building a Great Engineering Team

### The right individuals making the biggest impact.

A team is, indeed, more than just a group of individuals. However, without the
right individuals, there is no team. It’s important to hire right people, in
terms of talent, skill, temperament and experience and ensure that their vision
aligns with the culture you wish to create. For us, some traits such as
humility, ability to admit mistakes and desire to learn and participate were as
important as competitiveness, problem solving skills and technological
competency.

Further, to enable these individuals to shine in their individual capacities, it
is best to organize them in small teams. Small teams ensure clarity of
individual roles and responsibilities and ownership of product areas.

### Ensuring diversity in skills, backgrounds, attitude and temperament.

Diversity is not just a buzzword. In fact, a truly diverse yet cohesive team is
advantageous for the long term success of a company, as it tends to focus more
on objective facts and information, is more innovative, and assimilates
information in creative ways – things that are critical to a quality product
development process.

### Creating an open and conducive environment via shared goals and understanding.

Once a diverse team&mdashwith varied capabilities and strengths&mdashis in
place, it’s essential to ensure that they all pull together in a desired
direction. Every single individual must be aware of the what, why, when and how
of both their part and the overall product. They must have a clear picture of
the end product vision and the product roadmap, and their role in it. An
outcome-based approach for every person is most suitable for individuals to have
clarity on and responsibility for their roles.

Encourage fully transparent and honest communications across all stakeholders
including clients and partners, and open debates and discussions in the company.

### Diversifying talent pool to India to derive maximum benefits.

Every product company wants to tap into the benefits of engineering talent pool
available in India. There is a certain lack of clarity, however, on the part of
companies. Companies need to have a clear vision of whether they are looking for
“good engineering talent” or “cost-effective offshore resources”. These two
pools are different. While “cost-effective resources” have high availability and
lower costs, “good engineering talent”, in India or anywhere, requires time and
effort to hire and is competitively priced as was evident from our hiring ratio
of 1 out of 40 resumes. Further, there are additional challenges of retaining
this talent pool due to high demand for them in the start-up/product space.

As a start-up, we have invested abundantly to build a solid foundational team of
engineers that will have significant impact on the long-term success of our
products and customers.

### Integrating teams across locations into one cohesive unit.

Cultures are easier to create at the outset than to change later. From the
start, we focused on creating “One Spraoi” with a cross-functional focus on
quality product development for our customers. To the end, it was imperative for
us to create a non-hierarchical, transparent and open environment for all to
contribute and participate.

### Creating the right structure for “One Company” environment.

Create regular forums for practitioners around the globe to participate as one
team, including virtual town-halls, All Hands Meetings and Engineering sprints,
irrespective of locations, units or expertise.

Allow for uninhibited and open communication across all levels through a focus
on peer-to-peer communication. While practitioners may feel limited freedom to
express new or untested ideas during upward communication to supervisors,
peer-to-peer communication has been shown to facilitate a more open exchange.

Encourage everyone to share ideas and critiques. The more ideas a company
considers through the evaluation and product development process, the better the
final product will be. Furthermore, the smaller product features or design
suggestions that are key to a great product are more likely to come from people
directly involved in those areas.

<span class="underline">Trusting and assigning ownership to everyone</span>
<br />As Emerson once said “Treat a man as he is, and he will remain as he is.
Treat a man as he could be, and he will become what he should be.” Trusting and
assigning ownership to every individual on team, creates create a virtuous cycle
for both the individual and the company.

### Effective management and regular feedback at the individual level.

Finally, it is critical to tailor your approach to team management at the
individual level, as every practitioner comes with particular strengths,
weaknesses and needs. A continuous process of 1:1 discussions, tailored learning
and development approach and personal feedback builds trust while improving
overall performance of the team.

Indeed, building and nurturing a great engineering culture is a continuous
journey that requires organizations to focus on many fronts, from company and
product strategy to practical, day-to-day operations. At Spraoi, we embrace each
stage of this process fully as we strive to create customer centric products for
our customers.
