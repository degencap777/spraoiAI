  The best thing about life is that learning never ends. Our desire for both
  personal and professional development keeps us asking questions and each
  experience that we have provides some sort of lesson about ourselves or the
  changing world around us.

I had an amazing opportunity to begin my career as a software development intern
at Spraoi. The internship was a great learning experience and paved the way for
me to grow personally and professionally. From the beginning of my internship, I
felt like a part of the Spraoi team and that my work is important and impactful.
The collaborative culture of the organization was evident in every discussion I
was a part of.

Perhaps one of the best things about working at a startup is the opportunity to
branch out beyond your specific area of focus and expand your horizons. The
tasks and projects I worked on during my internship helped me gain functional
knowledge, an understanding of end to end workflow, and the ability to tie it up
in business requirements. Every task I pursued allowed me to develop a wide
range of skills vital to my project and made me realize that growth happens
outside your comfort zone. Throughout my journey, I was able to accept new
challenges with the guidance of my mentors and come out successfully even when I
hit a few roadblocks. It was exciting to work in a fast-paced environment with
cutting edge technologies and every day brought in a new opportunity to learn
and grow.

True learning happens when we reflect on our experience. Reflecting on the wide
spectrum of things I have learned from my internship, I plan on applying those
lessons to solve exciting challenges in my current role as a Software Engineer
at Spraoi. I look forward to the progress ahead.
