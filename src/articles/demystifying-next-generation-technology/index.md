  A personal journey from Silicon Valley startups to Apple to the insurance
  industry, and the lessons learned that have been applied for you.

I fell in love with programming at the age of nine when I was introduced to
Pascal. Luckily, both programming languages and my understanding of computer
science have come a long way. When I finished graduate studies at Carnegie
Mellon, I started working for Oracle as an Application Developer followed by a
start up. This experience proved invaluable, affording me the opportunity to
understand what it takes to build scalable software solutions end-to-end. There
is no such thing as “someone else’s problem” on a team of four engineers!

My experience with startups made me hungry to apply the principles learned there
on a larger scale. Enter Apple, where I started working on the iTunes team and
leading many development efforts. In the heart of Silicon Valley, I noticed an
interesting trend. My engineering colleagues didn’t spend enough time applying
the right technology to a problem set, gravitating instead to the
&quot;technology du jour.&quot; This predilection caused the need for increased
governance and costly cycle times lost. It was clear to me that this approach
was flawed, and the business problem that we are trying to solve should dictate
the technology chosen. My Apple experiences reinforced that pragmatism. My love
of startup culture and industrial Apple methods came together with AI:
artificial intelligence.

That’s what I love most about technology. The learning never stops!

How does all this apply to Insurance, you ask? Leveraging my experiences as a
consumer and augmenting through engagement with Matt and Karan, I understand the
technology challenges insurers face. I want to demystify technology for the
insurance sector. Next generation technologies don’t have to come at prohibitive
price points, and taking them on should be an exciting experience, not a scary
one.

Matt, Karan and I feel confident that the pragmatic approach we bring to solving
business problems will transform your insurance business. We are excited to
partner with you, and deliver on our promise of tailored solutions at reasonable
prices.
