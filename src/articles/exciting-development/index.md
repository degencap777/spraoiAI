We are excited to announce the acquisition of NaviRisk and the CoRIE platform by
Spraoi! NaviRisk has been a trusted partner of ours, and through integration of
CoRIE with our continuous delivery infrastructure, we can provide a
comprehensive life and annuities machine learning suite to our clients which
includes policyholder lapse predictions.

With this acquisition, Spraoi continues to expand machine learning offerings to
better serve our clients across insurance lines and functions. The NaviRisk team
will move into Spraoi’s Bangalore, India development center. With the addition
of NaviRisk’s Sandeep Patil to our India leadership team, Spraoi looks forward
to continue incubating enhanced solutions and offerings, now expanding into the
actuarial space.
