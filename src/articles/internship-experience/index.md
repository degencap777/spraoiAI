Internships are a great way to learn. This was the case during my internship
experience at Spraoi. With my background in engineering management and data
analytics, I was hunting for internship opportunities that I felt would be the
best fit and help me advance my skills for a career in the technology solutions
and consulting space. Fortunately, I came across an opportunity at Spraoi.

Through my role within the company as an analyst and project management intern,
I learned a great deal that cannot be conveyed in the classroom. The internship
provided me with an environment to put all my theoretical knowledge to practice
and into perspective by working on deliverables for a client with the Spraoi
team. The organization and its dynamics came as quite a surprise to me.
Realizing that the majority of the people working at the organization work in a
virtual environment, I was struck by how efficiently and synchronously all the
project related tasks were segregated and accomplished over remote conferencing
(e.g. Slack, Google Hangout) inspired me.

I realize how important the project management aspect is in a scenario like to
this. To make sure all the deadlines are met and the solution is delivered
swiftly and in accordance with client expectations. The start-up environment and
horizontal hierarchy of the organization gave me access and the freedom to talk
to anyone within the organization for guidance without any restrictions. This
not only helped me approach my superiors easily but also allowed me to interact
with them, learn from their experience and receive valuable advice. This is a
distinct advantage to working for a start-up. The culture, particularly in the
case of Spraoi, keeps you on your toes by challenging the individual with
engaging tasks. It provides opportunities for one-on-one mentoring and close
attention to each individual of the organization, thereby making it easier to
track individual productivity, and also provide detailed feedback for
self-improvement. In my case, weekly feedback on progress and constructive
feedback helped me take a step back and work on the areas which needed
improvement. As a result, the improvement of my technical and professional
skills was easily measured through the accomplishment and accuracy of subsequent
tasks.

The most noticeable feature I observed during my time with Spraoi was how open
and embracing the organization was in accepting new people and entrusting them
with responsibilities that include deliverables for the client. This may be a
little daunting and nerve-wracking for a new intern in the organization, but as
time progresses, you learn to keep up with the tasks and learn to prioritize
your tasks. The time that I had spent interning with Spraoi helped me get a
glimpse into sprint planning and project management. Being part of an actual
client project provided me perspective as to what goes into technology solution
delivery. My internship experience with Spraoi was fulfilling and I&#39;m glad
to have been part of an organization that is making its Insurance clients
future-ready in the machine learning and customer experience disciplines.
