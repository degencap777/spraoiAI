Spraoi announced today that Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company (Reliance
Standard) successfully deployed models for the identification of operational
inconsistencies (e.g. churning, anomalous activity) across new business and
in-force transactions within their block of traditional and indexed annuity
business. The Spraoi solution now provides visibility into transactions for
increased scrutiny for all Reliance Standard's annuity products. The scope of
this project was to complete a review of Reliance Standard's historical
transactions to develop models that will identify transactions that should be
further analyzed. The successful completion of this program provides Reliance
Standard with a tool to screen all transactions, increasing safeguards for their
customers.

“Taking a proactive stance on the detection of operational anomalies will
improve our ability to protect the well-being of our customers,“ said Kyle Ryan,
Reliance Standard's VP Operations of Retirement Services.
