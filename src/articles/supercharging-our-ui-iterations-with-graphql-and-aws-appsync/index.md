title: Supercharging Our UI Iterations with GraphQL & AWS AppSync

  How we are reducing friction as our applications evolve.

If there‚Äôs one thing about ‚ÄúAgile‚Äù software development that resonates, it would
be its iterative nature. Incorrect assumptions are inevitable when building
complex products‚Äîso let‚Äôs give ourselves the ability to quickly update a system
based on them.

For any significant product feature developed by Spraoi, three things happen:

1. We define feature requirements.
2. A backend developer creates endpoints to expose some data.
3. A frontend developer creates a UI to display and/or modify the data.

This process is great for an initial version, but...

> Incorrect assumptions are inevitable.

What happens when a significant change is required, or another feature request
comes through that requires data from a different endpoint? Assuming a backend
change isn‚Äôt strictly required, a frontend developer will be forced to repurpose
various endpoints, designed based on the initial requirements, in a decidedly
suboptimal way:

- Additional API calls will be added, increasing page load time.
- Ad hoc data parsing/normalization/caching code will be added, increasing app
  complexity, time spent coding, and overall bundle size.

How can these pitfalls be prevented?

## GraphQL

Taken from the [GraphQL homepage](https://graphql.org):

> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those
> queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and
> understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to
> ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve
> APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

With GraphQL, our frontend code only has to declare the specific data it needs;
it¬†*doesn‚Äôt care* where data comes from or how it‚Äôs fetched. No matter how
complex the orchestration of our backend endpoints get, our UI is only concerned
with the well-defined data models determined by a
[GraphQL schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/).

Now, you might be wondering, where _does_ all of this complex orchestration
exist?

## AWS AppSync

Taken from the [AppSync homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/):

> AWS AppSync simplifies application development by letting you create a
> flexible API to securely access, manipulate, and combine data from one or more
> data sources. AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL to make it easy
> for applications to get exactly the data they need.

So, AppSync provides a ‚Äúserverless‚Äù layer where we can mold our data into the
structure defined by our GraphQL schema before sending it off to a client.

Moving this complexity away from the UI immediately solves the aforementioned
pitfalls. If a feature requires additional data, we simply add the structure of
the data we need to the existing
[GraphQL query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/). _That‚Äôs it_. A single HTTP
request is sent to AppSync with this query, and we receive all of the data we
need in one go. üéâ
