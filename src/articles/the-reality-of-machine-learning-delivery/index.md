  Machine learning is not just a buzzword. If done right, it can drive results.

We embarked on our Machine Learning journey a little over a year ago and what a
year it has been! On reflection, I feel great about the fact that we have more
than proven our hypotheses around Machine Learning in Insurance. From the
outset, we always felt that horizontal Machine Learning platforms have solved
the problem of rapidly running algorithms and reducing the time it takes to
settle on a model that best fits the data. However, all those platforms assume
that the data would be pre-processed and presented in a way that can be consumed
by the platforms. While this may be true in certain cases, it’s not often the
case in insurance, especially in the retail life and group/ voluntary business.

As anyone that has spent time in the insurance sector will tell you,
organizations are plagued by legacy technologies and the data obtained from core
systems (e.g. administration or claims) is not always the cleanest. While
several companies have embarked on or completed core system transformations, the
challenge of maximizing the value of this data still exists.

We, at Spraoi, have focused on solving this problem. Our Machine Learning
platform automates the ingestion of the data and provides a complete toolkit to
data scientists that facilitates not only model building but maintaining models
in production. Our platform serves to empower the data science teams at
insurance firms (or to use data science as a service), and not displace them.

Further, to realize value from a machine learning model, business context and
knowledge of the domain is invaluable. We continue to see the benefits of our
domain experts working with our clients to build the best possible machine
learning based solutions and even more importantly look for ways to
operationalize the models to drive results. In the next few sprints, we are
working on making our platform more prescriptive and user friendly. We will
bring greater visibility to the end-to-end process, and encourage
experimentation. We can’t wait to share the details with you soon.
