I lived in Saudi Arabia, spent most of my childhood in Canada and now reside in
Chicago. In addition the places I have called home, I have travelled
extensively, to approximately 15 countries over my 24 years. These experiences
have given me a window into many diverse cultures and ways of life that are
quite different than the way we live in the US.

Perhaps the most dramatic differences were observed during my many trips to
India. As both of my parents are Indian natives, we traveled to the country
quite frequently, sometimes multiple times a year. India has one of the largest
economies on the world, however the income polarization between the wealthy and
the very poor is shocking. This was apparent to me even as a child and informed
my worldview and gave me a level of empathy that I would not otherwise have
possessed. Subsequently, each additional country I visited or lived in
reinforced this empathy, teaching me to understand and relate to diverse groups
of people and circumstances.

These qualities can and should be applied to the business world. Empathy in the
workplace, especially in consulting, is a valuable asset as it allows us to
better understand problems and provide more efficient solutions. At Spraoi,
intuitive problem solving is at the core of everything we do. The diversity of
our team, both in background and life experience, allows us to effectively
relate to and empathize with our clients, better understanding their needs and
enabling us to deliver the most effective results for both the short and long
term.

I believe that every experience provides lessons for how to better engage with
others, including clients. The world is a never-ending source of knowledge and
experiences and the culture at Spraoi allows and encourages us to continually
reach, learn and grow, for our benefit and that of the clients we serve. As
Shakespeare said “The world is your oyster,” so let’s go collect our pearls!
