  solution for insurance products for the agent, employer and employee user
  experience
- Current state process was limited in terms of ease of use provided for the
  viewing of claims across products, updating information related to coverages,
  salary and dependents
- User administrative console features were limited and required significant
  dependency on IT and help desk

## Solution

- Configurable and persona driven user interface that supports a product suite
  that spans – Dental, Vision, Life, LTD, STD, Statutory Disability, Paid Family
  Leave, Accident
- An integrated solution across the product suite with API based integration
  with the client’s choice of policy admin system

## Impact

- Completely integrated seamless experience for employer and enrollee to view
  and update information related to coverages, dependents and documents
  associated with the coverage
- Increased efficiency with providing user control over ancillary features such
  as administrative console
- Easy end user access to documents housed within the policy admin system
- Access to analytics to surface adoption of portal across the user base and
  product suite
