## The Challenge

> A multi-line insurance carrier in the group and voluntary product lines was
> looking to gain efficiencies across new case setup, enrollment and in-force
> service. The client was looking for a solution to expand both capabilities and
> access to transaction processing across several key stakeholders:
> agents/brokers, employers, employees/enrollees and carrier practitioners.

## Solution

> Spraoi’s Kwikcover asset was configured to provide a customer experience
> across products (Dental, Vision, Life, STD, LTD, Statutory Disability, Paid
> Family Leave and Accident) across multiple stakeholder personas as elaborated
> in the challenge. An integrated solution across the product suite with
> API-based integration with the client’s policy administration system was
> delivered.

## Impact

> Spraoi’s Kwikcover portal solution deployed and provided the following lift
> immediately:
>
> - Completely integrated seamless experience for employer and enrollee to view
>   and update information related to coverages, dependents and documents
>   associated with the coverage.
> - Increased efficiency with providing user control over ancillary features
>   such as administrative console.
> - Easy user access to documents housed within the policy administration
>   system.
> - Access to analytics to surface adoption of portal across the user base and
>   product suite.
