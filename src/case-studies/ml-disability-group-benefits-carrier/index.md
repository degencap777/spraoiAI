## The Challenge

> A multi-line insurance carrier pays approximately \$400M in annual disability
> indemnity (STD and LTD). They were looking to bolster their claims
> capabilities, and were looking to leverage their data to better advantage.

## Solution

> Base models were initially tuned to the client’s data and the production
> deployment of the models took less than six weeks (using Spraoi’s UX). Ongoing
> feedback was received through this mechanism to feed the continuous learning
> loop in production.

## Impact

> Spraoi models brought immediate and lasting lift to the client’s results:
>
> - ~15% of LTD claims were tagged as likely candidate for settlement, with 84%
>   accuracy increasing the efficiency of the overall settlement process.
> - ~2% of claims were tagged as inconsistent for review of any potential fraud
>   by client business team.
