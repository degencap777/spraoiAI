## The Challenge

- The client was looking for a structured and operationally efficient approach
  to identify STD, LTD fraud and potential LTD claims for settlement
- Current state process did not systematically tag claims marked as fraud or
  settlement candidates
- The current procedures did not have any feedback loop to improve the rate of
  fraud detection or identify higher propensity settlement claims

## Solution

- Claims data was mapped to Spraoi ML models and base Disability ML models were
  deployed for the client
- Based on the business user feedback from the usage of the models, tags were
  identified to have a dataset specific to client
- Based on the client specific dataset created from usage of base models, ML
  models were tuned with client data
- Ongoing feedback on ML predictions created additional data to fine tune
  production models

## Impact

- 60% of all the LTD claim predictions were reviewed by business to develop a
  baseline tagged data
- ~15% of LTD claims were tagged as likely candidate for settlement
- 84% of the cases business agreed with ML prediction for Settlement (278 claims
  of the 329 claims flagged as candidates for settlement)
- ~2% of the claim population was tagged as inconsistent for review of any
  potential fraud by client business team
