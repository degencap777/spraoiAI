bio: >
  I have always looked to be in a challenging environment to gain knowledge and
  make an impact. Having the ability work with an extremely talented team and
  grow professionally alongside the organization is what has led me to Spraoi.
  My role has allowed me to leverage my engineering knowledge to work with our
  clients to transform their current processes through technology. 

  I have a Master of Science in Industrial Engineering with a focus on Data
  Science and Operations. Management. This has given me the aptitude to problem
  solve and think outside the box I am excited for the opportunity to manage
  client relationships and support technical deliveries for complex projects. 
  Spraoi has welcomed me and my fresh perspective to deliver the best possible
  solutions to our clients.
