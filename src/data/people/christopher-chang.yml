bio: >
  I have a passion for solving problems, and am deeply gratified when our
  solutions improve our clients’ outcomes. Through almost 15 years as a
  management consultant, I have been exposed to a multitude of industries and
  continuously learned different approaches and methods to solving my clients’
  greatest challenges. I joined Spraoi to bring my flexible mindset together
  with Spraoi’s technology capabilities to more efficiently create solutions for
  clients with greater impact – practical, insightful, and quick.

  Prior to joining Spraoi, I worked as a hedge fund analyst before embarking on
  the journey as a consultant at PwC and EY. While at Spraoi, I continue to
  provide advisory services in pursuit of new opportunities to improve the
  insurance industry.
