  Scientists study the world as it is, engineers create the world that has never
  been and at Spraoi we are doing the same for the insurance industry. As an
  engineer I am passionate about solving complex problems. 

  Before joining Spraoi, I worked in MNC (Samsung) as well as at a Danish
  startup in Thailand (Chilindo) as an ML engineer.), At Spraoi, we are building
  disruptive solution for the insurance industry and I am contributing by
