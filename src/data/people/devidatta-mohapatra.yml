bio: >
  The opportunity to be part of something from the ground up is was intrigued me
  about Spraoi, and sustains me now. While I love to code, it is exhilarating to
  know that what we build today will be used by our clients for years to come.
  When we accomplish tasks amongst our team, I see the difference. Everyone
  feels the same way. Bringing our vision to change the insurance experience is
  coming to life. This enthusiasm has me willing to leave my comfort zone and
  grow, whether about content, technology or team role.

  I love the start up environment. It has helped me grow as a programmer. At
  Spraoi I get to work as a backend developer with various technologies, and
  chart new solutions through machine learning. I look forward to prosper as a
  valuable member of this company.
