bio: >
  I have always loved solving problems. With a background in Information Science
  and fascination with the wide gamut of problems across multiple disciplines
  Data Science can be applied to, I have developed strong programming
  fundamentals and a passion for Data Science.

  Spraoi provides the opportunity to continuously bring my solutions and ideas
  to life while working on cutting-edge technology. In my current role as a
  Software Engineer, I am able to build software solutions with an algorithmic
  mindset and problem-solving propensity. Working in a fast-paced environment
  has helped me grow and leverage my technical skills.
