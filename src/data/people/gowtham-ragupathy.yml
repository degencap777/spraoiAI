bio: >
  Spraoi as a firm puts a premium on quality delivery. In my role as a quality
  assurance practitioner at Sproai, my focus is on ensuring we release quality
  products and updates to our clients. Spraoi provided an ideal opportunity for
  me to apply what I have learned over the years. I love to find bugs in code.
  Every instance identified strengthens the product, and our clientsâ€™ confidence
  in us.

  I am leading the institutionalization of a custom testing approach at Spraoi,
  leveraging the best of exploratory testing and thinking skills. I am excited
  to be a part of the Spraoi team, and contribute to the delivery of cutting
  edge solutions.
