bio: >
  As a product engineering lead at Sproai, I have the opportunity to be a part
  of the strategic development and delivery of cutting edge solutions. It is my
  joy to focus on solving our clients’ business problems through
  technology-driven solutions. We bring a lean, driven and innovative approach
  that yields benefits that are truly differentiating, in both experience and
  outcome, from anywhere else I have worked.

  I come to Spraoi with strategy and management consulting experience from
  Deloitte, and technology delivery acumen from Cognizant. I have leveraged both
  to create a streamlined and strategic product roadmap geared for success.
  Spraoi’s approach is in perfect alignment with what I seek in a company. Being
  a part of this team has been the perfect balance of excitement and
  accomplishment.
