bio: >
  I have always had a huge interest in technology, and a love for solving
  problems. Application delivery has provided a means to allow me to explore
  both of these interests. I worked in a variety of industries over the years
  and delivered software solutions to distribution, warehousing, retail,
  bottling and insurance clients. These varied industries provided me with
  different challenges and approaches for solving them. I rely on those
  experiences every day.

  Before joining Spraoi I spent over twenty years as a Technical Manager and
  Project Manager with CSC/DXC delivering insurance applications to the property
  and casualty industry. I led technical teams delivering applications for
  organizations varied in size from startups to large corporations. In my role
  with Spraoi I work with exceptional engineers daily to deliver solutions that
  positively impact day to day business.
