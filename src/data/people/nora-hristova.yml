bio: >
  My natural curiosity and the desire for exploration has led me to seek new
  experiences. That life view was what intrigued me about Spraoi, and has
  sustained me since joining the company. My role has afforded me the
  opportunity to learn how advanced technology can transform our future. Being
  part of a technology startup characterized by unique and innovative thinking
  allows me to accelerate my professional development and gain invaluable
  exposure to business and engineering.

  My international experience, studying and working in the US, Europe, Asia,
  Africa and the Middle East has provided me with a global mindset. I leverage
  my skills to propel our professional brand and enable the delivery of business
  outcomes by working closely with both our leadership and engineering teams.
  Spraoi values my fresh perspective, which enables me to make a real
  contribution to an exciting, technologically driven future.
