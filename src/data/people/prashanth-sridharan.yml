bio: >
  An entrepreneurial business-oriented technology leader, helping organizations
  drive sustainable growth and operational excellence through technology
  leadership, strategy, transformation and innovation. Prashanth specializes in
  delivering cutting edge business strategies and technology solutions across
  all lines of Insurance. At Spraoi, Prashanth is responsible for leading
  business development, go to market strategies and delivering complex
  technology enabled business transformations.

  It is now becoming obvious that the accelerating pace of technological change
  is the most creative force—and, the most destructive one—in the financial
  services ecosystem today. Digital, intelligence and automation are now
  mainstream capabilities and I am very enthusiastic and eager to solve for
  these through Spraoi’s technology-driven innovation.

  Prior to Spraoi, Prashanth was a senior leader at Deloitte’s Insurance
  Technology Consulting practice, serving global financial institutions. Most
  recently Prashanth was the global head of technology strategy and solutions at
  a Fortune 500 Innovative Workforce Solutions company.
