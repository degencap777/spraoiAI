bio: >
  Experience delivering business and technology insurance solutions for over two
  decades led me to the conclusion that there is a way to accelerate deployment
  of disruptive technologies and superior operating results. This led me to be
  part of Spraoi, as we shared the same vision.

  In my role as Group Benefits leader at Spraoi, I am focused on developing and
  delivering solutions that address challenges in core group and voluntary
  markets. We optimize all functions in the value chain: distribution,
  enrollment, policy administration and claims. The ability to work with a
  cutting edge engineering team to deploy solutions in weeks (not months or
  years) to excellent business impact makes working at Spraoi a deeply
  fulfilling experience!
