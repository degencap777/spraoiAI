  With a keen eye for detail, I tend to keep things simple, minimal, functional,
  and straightforward. This is why user experience appeals to me. It is also the
  reason why Spraoi, with its dedicated approach towards solving problems using
  industry defining technology, is an amazing place to be.

  Though pixel perfect feature implementations come as second nature, I tend to
  put in a lot of thought into the “why’s” of a solution or feature. This helps
  me get an insight as to how our users would use it, which in turn lets me
  implement it in a more user-friendly way. Spraoi enables me to be and deliver
  my best along with the opportunities to dive into some of the forefronts of
  consumer technologies.
