bio: >
  My experience as a Software Engineer at Spraoi has helped me inculcate a new
  and positive outlook to the field of Data Science and its applications in the
  real world . Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work closely with an exceptional team
  pioneering best attainable solutions to our clients in the insurance space.

  I have an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
  Spraoi acknowledges my appetite to learn and has provided a platform to
  utilise my strong engineering background in adding value to the organization.
