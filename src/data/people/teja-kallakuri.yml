bio: >
  I have witnessed firsthand the strides made in the field of data science over
  the last few years. The impact data science has on businesses through the
  discipline of machine learning is permeating every industry. I am driven to
  contribute to this evolution, building machine learning products and services
  that can tackle problems faced everyday in our working lives.

  Having worked in large companies prior to joining Spraoi, Iâ€™ve felt the energy
  and enthusiasm from working in a small group of focused and highly driven
  individuals solving challenging business problems through machine learning
  products and services. Spraoi, for me, has been the perfect place to apply my
  data science and machine learning skills.
