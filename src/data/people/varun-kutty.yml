bio: >
  My professional life has been oriented on the delivery of large complex
  technology programs. However, I had found their ability to fundamentally
  transform insurance companies uneven. At Spraoi, I am leveraging my past
  experience in core systems transformation to help take new insurance platforms
  and products to the market. Outcome driven technology delivery, the ethos of
  Spraoi, resonates with my passion and has me excited about our clients
  challenges and opportunities everyday.

  Prior to joining Spraoi, I worked at Deloitte Consulting LLP as Delivery Lead
  for large P&C and L&A insurance transformation programs across US, Canada and
  Europe. I am excited to be part of Spraoi where I can work with and learn from
  colleagues and deliver technology, not just configuration/integration. This
  shift in control over the outcome, and maximizing value for our clients
  through technology, is what sets us apart.
